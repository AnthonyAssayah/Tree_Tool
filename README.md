# TreeWalker

This project implements the "tree" tool in a long mode, which displays the file tree with permissions, user and group information, and size. The tool recursively traverses the directory tree, starting from the current folder, and prints the file and directory structure in a tree-like format.


## Output

The tool will display the file tree structure with the following information for each file or directory:

- Permissions: The file permissions are displayed as a combination of characters representing read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions for the owner, group, and others.
- User and Group: The tool shows the username and group name associated with each file or directory.
- Size: The size of the file or directory is displayed in bytes.
- File/Directory Name: The name of the file or directory is shown.
The tree structure is represented using special characters (-, |, etc.) to indicate the hierarchy of directories.

At the end of the output, the tool provides a summary of the total number of directories and files found in the tree.

## Example

Here is an example of the output generated by the "stree" tool:

## Usage

To compile the project, navigate to the project directory in the terminal and execute the following command:

```
make
```
This command will compile the source code and generate an executable named "stree".
Then to run the "stree" tool, use the following command:
```
./stree [directory]
```
By default, if no directory is specified, the tool will start from the current directory.
